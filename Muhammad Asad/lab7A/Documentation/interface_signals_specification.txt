	Synchronous FIFO Interface Signals Description

-----------------------------------------------------------------

--> clk
Description: 	System clock input for synchronous FIFO operations.
Direction: 	Input
Width: 		1

--> rst_n
Description: 	Active-low reset to initialize FIFO pointers, counters, and memory.
Direction: 	Input
Width: 		1

--> wr_en
Description: 	Write enable signal; when high, wr_data is written into FIFO if not full.
Direction: 	Input
Width: 		1

--> wr_data[DATA_WIDTH-1:0]
Description: 	Data input bus for writing new data into FIFO memory.
Direction: 	Input
Width: 		DATA_WIDTH (default 8)

--> rd_en
Description: 	Read enable signal; when high, data is read from FIFO if not empty.
Direction: 	Input
Width: 		1

--> rd_data[DATA_WIDTH-1:0]
Description: 	Data output bus; provides data read from FIFO.
Direction: 	Output
Width: 		DATA_WIDTH 

--> full
Description: 	Asserted when FIFO is completely full (no more writes allowed).
Direction: 	Output
Width: 		1

--> empty
Description: 	Asserted when FIFO is completely empty (no more reads allowed).
Direction: 	Output
Width: 		1

--> almost_full
Description: 	Asserted when FIFO occupancy reaches or exceeds ALMOST_FULL_THRESH.
Direction: 	Output
Width: 		1

--> almost_empty
Description: 	Asserted when FIFO occupancy is less than or equal to ALMOST_EMPTY_THRESH.
Direction: 	Output
Width: 		1

--> count[$clog2(FIFO_DEPTH):0]
Description: 	Current FIFO elements count.
Direction: 	Output
