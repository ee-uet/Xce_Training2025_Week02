	Programmable Counter interface Signals Description

------------------------------------------------------------------

--> clk:
Description: 	System clock input. Counting operations occur on the rising edge of this clock.
Direction: 	Input.
Width: 		1 bit.

--> rst_n:
Description: 	Active-low reset signal. When deasserted (0), the counter is reset to 0.
Direction: 	Input.
Width: 		1 bit.

-->load:
Description:	Load control signal. When high (1), the counter value is immediately loaded with load_value.
Direction: 	Input.
Width: 		1 bit.

--> enable:
Description: 	Enable control signal. When high (1), counting is enabled. When low, the counter holds its current value.
Direction: 	Input.
Width: 		1 bit.

--> up_down:
Description: 	Direction control signal.
		1 → Count up
		0 → Count down
Direction: 	Input.
Width: 		1 bit.

--> load_value[7:0]:
Description: 	8-bit value to be loaded into the counter when load is asserted.
Direction: 	Input.
Width: 		8 bits.

--> max_count[7:0]:
Description: 	8-bit maximum count value. When counting up, reaching this value asserts tc and wraps back to 0. When counting down, reaching 0 wraps back 		to this value.
Direction: 	Input.
Width: 		8 bits.

--> count[7:0]:
Description: 	Current 8-bit counter value.
Direction: 	Output.
Width: 		8 bits.

--> tc (terminal count):
Description: 	Status flag, asserted high (1) when the counter reaches max_count.
Direction: 	Output.
Width: 		1 bit.

--> zero:
Description: 	Status flag, asserted high (1) when the counter value is 0.
Direction: 	Output.
Width: 		1 bit.
