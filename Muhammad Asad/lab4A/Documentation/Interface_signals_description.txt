	Traffic light controller module interface and internal signals Description

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interface Signals
-----------------

--> clk
Description: 	System clock input. Drives both FSM and timer modules.
Direction: 	Input
Width: 		1 bit

--> rst_n
Description: 	Active-low reset. Resets FSM, timer, and outputs.
Direction: 	Input
Width: 		1 bit

--> emergency
Description: 	Emergency vehicle request input. When asserted, system overrides normal operation and activates emergency mode.
Direction: 	Input
Width: 		1 bit

--> pedestrian_req
Description: 	Pedestrian crossing request input. When asserted, FSM transitions to pedestrian walk state after current cycle.
Direction: 	Input
Width: 		1 bit

--> ns_lights[1:0]
Description: 	North–South traffic light outputs:
		00 → Red flashing
		01 → Green
		10 → Yellow
		11 → Red
Direction: 	Output
Width: 		2 bits

--> ew_lights[1:0]
Description: 	East–West traffic light outputs (same encoding as ns_lights).
Direction: 	Output
Width: 		2 bits

--> ped_walk
Description: 	Pedestrian walk signal (asserted when pedestrians are allowed to cross).
Direction: 	Output
Width: 		1 bit

--> emergency_active
Description: 	Status output, asserted high when system is in emergency override mode.
Direction: 	Output
Width: 		1 bit

Internal Signals
----------------

--> count_start
Description: 	Control signal from FSM to timer; starts countdown.
Width: 		1 bit

--> count_value[4:0]
Description: 	Countdown value loaded into timer for current light phase duration.
Width: 		5 bits

--> count_done
Description: 	Status flag from timer to FSM; asserted when timer reaches zero.
Width: 		1 bit
